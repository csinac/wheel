# The Wheel of Pseudo Fortune
The Wheel of Pseudo Fortune, or just the wheel, is a Unity asset that helps you create a wheel of fortune - either in the UI or in world space.

The Wheel is constructed in a way that each slot is a subwheel, so you can string rolls (e.g. first roll for a category, then an item, then a rarity level) and create nested probabilities.

The Wheel provides a callback for the Roll event, to which you can register your own custom functionality. In addition, the example renderers I'll keep adding to this package all inherit the same renderer class, making it highly customizable.
